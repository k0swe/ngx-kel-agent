# ngx-kel-agent

This is a client library for Angular applications to integrate with
[`kel-agent`](https://github.com/k0swe/kel-agent). It provides an Angular service that creates and
manages the websocket connection, and exposes incoming messages as `Observable`s and outgoing
messages as method calls.
